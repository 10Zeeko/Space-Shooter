# Space Shooter - 10Zeeko
## Introduction
This is a simple vertical space shooter game made in pygame where you control a spaceship and try to survive as long as possible against waves of enemies. 

How to Play
To play the game, use the following controls:

- A/D or Left/Right arrow keys: Move your spaceship left and right
- SPACE, W or UP arrow key: Shoot lasers

You have to avoid enemy fire and collisions, and you can collect powerups that give you different weapons or abilities. The game has different types of enemies that behave differently, such as moving in different patterns, shooting different weapons, or having different health. The game also has some obstacles or hazards that you have to avoid.

The player has a limited number of lives. You lose a life when you are hit by an enemy or an obstacle. You can restore your lives by collecting powerups. The game also shows your score on the screen, which increases when you destroy enemies.

If you survive until the end, you win the game and see the victory screen. If you lose all your lives, you lose the game and see the game over screen.
